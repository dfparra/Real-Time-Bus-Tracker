# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Project Description
This project uses mapbox, an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page, along with the JavaScript library mapboxgl to display Markers on the map that track coordinates of a bus route traveling from MIT to Harvard.

### How to Run
1. Create a Mapbox account and generate an access token
2. Copy then paste your access token into the mapanimation.js on line 18
3. Load the HTML page and click the button to watch the marker move across the map

### Roadmap of future improvements
* Add more bus routes
* Add more cities
* Add user interface to switch between routes and cities
* Dynamically fetch and load bus routes
